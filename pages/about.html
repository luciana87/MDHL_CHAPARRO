                        The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing 
                        Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a 
                        member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside 
                        neighborhood. MDHL ran by o small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer 
                        time of parents and previous league members.
